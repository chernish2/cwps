# cwps
Ruby script for running aircrack-ng and reaver in automatic mode

Run this as root:
sudo ruby swps.rb

Script will automatically check for needed dependencies, turn on monitor mode on your wireless adapter, check for available WiFi access points, and then run Reaver on the selected access point.

Please feel free to write me any suggestions or bug reports.
